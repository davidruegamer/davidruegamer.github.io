I am an Associate Professor at the LMU Munich, heading the [Munich Uncertainty Quantification AI Lab](https://www.muniq.ai), an [Ellis Member](https://ellis.eu/), Associated Fellow of the [Konrad Zuse School of
Excellence in Reliable AI (relAI)](https://zuseschoolrelai.de/), and also a Principal Investigator of the [Munich Center for Machine Learning (MCML)](https://mcml.ai/). 

My current research involves the development of **uncertainty quantification** for deep learning approaches (using e.g. a [Bayesian paradigm](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v235/papamarkou24b.html)), the **unification of concepts** from statistics and deep learning, and studying [**overparametrization** in neural networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03571). See also my [Google Scholar profile](https://scholar.google.de/citations?hl=de&user=_DYguksAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate) for some of my recent research.

I am committed to advancing my research field through active participation in the academic community: 
* as an action editor for the [JSS](https://www.jstatsoft.org/index) and [TMLR](https://jmlr.org/tmlr/), 
* as an area chair for several conferences such as *AIStats*, *ICLR*, *ICML*, *NeurIPS*, and *UAI*,
* as reviewer for many top-tier journals, including *Biometrika*, *EJS*, *JASA*, *JCGS*, *JMLR*, 
* as reviewer for the top machine learning conferences, including *AIStats*, *ICML*, *ICLR*, *NeurIPS*, *UAI*, where I am repeatedly among the top reviewers,
* participating in strategic meetings aimed at shaping the direction of research in the field, such as [Dagstuhl](https://www.dagstuhl.de/en/seminars/seminar-calendar/seminar-details/24461).
