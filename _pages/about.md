I am Associate Professor at the LMU Munich, heading the [Data Science Group](https://datascience-lmu.github.io/website/) and also a Principal Investigator of the [Munich Center for Machine Learning (MCML)](https://mcml.ai/). I am grateful that my research is funded by the [Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF)](https://www.bmbf.de/bmbf/en/home/home_node.html) and the [German Research Foundation (DFG)](https://www.dfg.de/en). Before joining the LMU, I was interim professor for Computational Statistics at the TU Dortmund (winter ‘22/23) and RWTH Aachen (summer ‘22). 

My current research involves the development of **uncertainty quantification** for deep learning approaches (using e.g. a [Bayesian paradigm](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v235/papamarkou24b.html)), the **unification of concepts** from statistics and deep learning, and studying [**overparametrization** in neural networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03571). See also my [Google Scholar profile](https://scholar.google.de/citations?hl=de&user=_DYguksAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate) for some of my recent research.

I am committed to advancing my research field through active participation in the academic community: 
* as an action editor for the [JSS](https://www.jstatsoft.org/index), 
* as an area chair for several conferences such as *NeurIPS* and *UAI*,
* as reviewer for many statistics and machine learning journals, including *Biometrika*, *Electronic Journal of Statistics*, *Journal of American Statistical Association*, *Journal of Graphical and Computational Statistics*, *Journal of Machine Learning Research*, and
* as reviewer for the top machine learning conferences, including *AAAI*, *AISTATS*, *ICML*, *ICLR*, *NeurIPS*, *UAI*, where I am repeatedly among the top reviewers.
