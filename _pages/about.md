I am Associate Professor at the LMU Munich running the [Data Science Group](https://datascience-lmu.github.io/website/) and PI of the [Munich Center for Machine Learning (MCML)](https://mcml.ai/). Before I was interim professor for Computational Statistics at the TU Dortmund (winter ‘22/23) and RWTH Aachen (summer ‘22) as well as interim professor for Data Science at the LMU Munich (summer + winter ‘21). 

My current research involves the development of **uncertainty quantification approaches** for statistical and machine learning models, the **unification of concepts** from statistics and deep learning, and **sparsification** of learning methods. See my [OpenReview](https://openreview.net/profile?id=~David_R%C3%BCgamer1) or [Google Scholar profile](https://scholar.google.de/citations?hl=de&user=_DYguksAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate) for some of my recent research.

I am action editor for the [JSS](https://www.jstatsoft.org/index), an associate editor for [AStA](https://www.springer.com/journal/10182), and a reviewer for many statistics and machine learning journals, including *Biometrika*, *Electronic Journal of Statistics*, *Journal of American Statistical Association*, *Journal of Graphical and Computational Statistics*, *Journal of Machine Learning Research*, *Statistics and Computing* as well as a regular reviewer/PC for the top machine learning conferences, including *AAAI*, *AISTATS*, *ECML-PKDD*, *ICML*, *ICRL*, *NeurIPS*, *UAI*, where I am repeatedly among the top reviewers.
